PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Your task is to design a test prep screen in Figma for an AI-driven software that helps users prepare for standardized tests. The interface should be visually appealing, user-friendly, and intuitive.

Your submission must be beautiful, and we encourage using design templates to help.

Objective

1. Problem - show a problem display with multiple-choice responses.

2. Tutor - include a chat interface for users to interact with the AI tutor and ask questions related to the problem.

3. Gamification - show points or progress, alluding to how much progress the user has made.

4. Responsiveness - ensure that the design is accessible, responsive, and adaptable to various screen sizes and devices.
